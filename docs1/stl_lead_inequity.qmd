# STL_HEALTH_Lead
*ABSTRACT from GitHub repository:* "This repository contains a map image of census tracts in St. Louis, Missouri, colored by the estimated number of high blood lead tests over the 2010-2015 period. The repository also contains a variety of plots describing high lead exposure in St. Louis and two demographic correlates - race and poverty." 

Here, we will conduct data exploration and visualization with the stl_blood_lead.csv file. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
stl_lead <- read.csv(here::here("data", "stl_blood_lead.csv"))

# view summary of dataset
skimr::skim(stl_lead)
